            <h1>Breath of the Wild</h1>

            <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure game developed and published by
            Nintendo, released for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles on March 3, 2017. Breath of the Wild
            is set at the end of the Zelda timeline; the player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year
            slumber to defeat Calamity Ganon before it can destroy the kingdom of Hyrule.<br><br>

            Similar to the original Legend of Zelda (1986), players are given little instruction and can explore
            the open world freely. Tasks include collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or solving
            puzzles and side quests for rewards. The world is unstructured and designed to reward
            experimentation, and the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.<br><br>

            Development of Breath of the Wild lasted five years. Wanting to reinvent the series, Nintendo
            introduced elements such as a detailed physics engine, high-definition visuals, and voice acting.
            Monolith Soft, known for their work in the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in
            designing landscapes and topography. The game was planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive,
            but was delayed twice due to problems with the physics engine. Breath of the Wild was a launch game
            for the Switch and the final game published by Nintendo for the Wii U. Two downloadable content
            packs were released later in 2017.</p>

            <h1>Animal Crossing New Horizons</h1>

            <p>As in previous installments in the Animal Crossing series, New Horizons is a nonlinear life simulation
                game played in real-time. The player assumes the role of a customizable character who moves to a
                deserted island after purchasing a vacation package from Tom Nook, a raccoon character who is a staple
                of the series. The game proceeds in an open-ended fashion as the player explores the island, and
                develops it into a community of anthropomorphic animals.<br><br>

                Players can collect different items to use as decorations within the game. Similar to the 2017 spin-off
                title Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, the game introduces a crafting system that allows the player to
                convert materials into tools and furniture, which can be used to decorate the game's interior and
                exterior spaces. The game will allow the player to customize the appearance of their character at
                will, and will not lock specific hairstyles or facial features to specific genders. Players will
                additionally be able to select their character's skin color, a feature introduced in the 2015 spin-off
                title Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer.</p>

            <h1>Splatoon 2</h1>

            <p>Like its predecessor, Splatoon 2 is a third-person shooter in which players control characters, known as
                Inklings and Octolings, and use colored ink as ammunition. Ink is also used to cover the ground, or any
                paintable surface, in order to swim or refill their ink tanks. Inklings and Octolings can morph between
                humanoid, or kid form, where they switch from walking, and shooting, into squid form where they can
                quickly swim through ink of their own color, and replenish their ink supply, as well as return to full
                health.<br><br>

                The sequel adds new standard, sub and special weapons, including dual-wield pistols called Dualies that
                allow the player to perform dodge rolls, shotgun-like weapons called Brellas that enable defensive
                maneuvers with folding shields, and jetpacks known as Inkjets. Like the previous game, it features the
                standard Turf War mode for Regular Battles, in which two four-player teams have three minutes to cover
                the most turf with their color of ink. Splatoon 2 also maintains the first game's rotation of Splat
                Zones, Tower Control and Rainmaker for Ranked Battles, unlocked at level ten, while also adding a new
                Clam Blitz mode. League Battles allow players to form teams with friends playing the same modes as in
                Ranked Battles. A new mode, Salmon Run, allows up to four players to team up cooperatively to tackle
                waves of enemies called Salmonids and collect Boss Salmonids' eggs.</p>

            <h1>Luigi's Mansion 3</h1>

            <p>Luigi's Mansion 3 is an action-adventure game developed by Next Level Games and published by Nintendo
                for the Nintendo Switch. It is a sequel to Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, and was released on October 31,
                2019. The game sees players taking on the role of Luigi who must explore a haunted hotel, incorporating
                different themes on each floor, and rescue his friends from the ghosts that inhabit it, after the group
                is tricked into visiting it for a vacation by an old foe.<br><br>

                Alongside a number of returning gameplay elements from previous installments, the game incorporates new
                features, including additional moves for ghost catching, a doppelgänger assistant for puzzle-solving
                (also known as Gooigi), and an improved multiplayer function that allows for players to engage in
                cooperative and competitive gaming both locally and online. The game received generally favorable
                reviews from critics. It was nominated for several awards, also winning some. As of December 31, 2019
                the game sold over five million copies worldwide.</p>

            <h1>Pokemon Sword and Shield</h1>

            <p>Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield[a] are 2019 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and
                published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. They are the first installments
                in the eighth generation of the Pokémon video game series and the second in the series, after Pokémon:
                Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, to be released on a home game console. Originally teased at E3
                2017 and announced in February 2019, Pokémon Sword and Shield were released on November 15,
                2019.<br><br>

                Sword and Shield's concept planning began immediately following the completion of Pokémon Sun and Moon
                in 2016, while full production began a year later in late 2017. Like previous installments, they
                chronicle the journey of a young Pokémon trainer aiming to become the Pokémon Champion, this time in the
                new Galar region, which is based on the United Kingdom. The main objective of the games is to dethrone
                the Pokémon League Champion, Leon, in a tournament that various other Gym Leaders and rivals also take
                part in, whilst dealing with Team Yell and a nefarious conspiracy within the League. Sword and Shield
                introduce 81 new Pokémon alongside 13 regional variants of pre-existing Pokémon; Dynamaxing, which
                increases the size of Pokémon under certain conditions; Gigantamaxing, which additionally changes the
                form of certain Pokémon; and the Wild Area, which is a large, open-world area with free camera movement
                that contains co-op raid battles. The two games also reintroduce features previously seen in Sun and
                Moon and Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, such as regional variants and roaming Pokémon depicted
                in the overworld. The games will receive two expansion packs in 2020, The Isle of Armor and The Crown
                Tundra.<br><br>

                The decision to not include all pre-existing Pokémon in Sword and Shield was met with backlash from a
                segment of the fan community, creating terms such as "Dexit" and "Bring Back National Dex" and calling
                for a boycott months ahead of their release. Despite this, Sword and Shield received generally positive
                reviews from critics. Particular praise was aimed at the creature design, new features, and the emphasis
                on simplicity, player freedom, and streamlined encounters, although some criticized the game's smaller
                Pokédex and lack of polish or substance. By the end of 2019, Sword and Shield had sold more than sixteen
                million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling games on the Switch.</p>

            <h1>Super Mario Odyssey</h1>

            <p>Super Mario Odyssey is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch on
                October 27, 2017. An entry in the Super Mario series, it follows Mario and Cappy, a sentient hat that
                allows Mario to control other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save
                Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser, who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear
                gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay
                featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.<br><br>

                The game was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, and began
                development soon after the release of Super Mario 3D World in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during
                development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a sandbox-style of gameplay. Unlike
                previous installments such as New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 3D World, which were aimed at a
                casual audience, the team designed Super Mario Odyssey to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also
                features a vocal theme song, "Jump Up, Super Star!", a first for the series.<br><br>

                Super Mario Odyssey received universal acclaim from critics who called it one of the best games in the
                series, with particular praise towards its inventiveness and originality. It also won numerous awards,
                including for game of the year. The game was also a commercial success, selling over 16.59 million
                copies by December 2019, which makes it one of the best-selling Switch games.</p>
